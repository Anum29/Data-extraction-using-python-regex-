# Data Extraction using Python Regex

## Overview

This Python script is designed to extract relevant client data from a text file. It includes functionality to process the text data, identify key information, and output the extracted data in a structured format. The code is intended to serve as a generic solution for extracting client data from various text formats.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script (`extract_client_data.py`).
2. Ensure that the text file containing client data (`AK2.txt`) is present in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using the command:

    ```bash
    python extract_client_data.py
    ```

4. The script will process the text file, extract relevant information, and display the output.

## Data Extraction Process

The script follows a step-by-step process to extract client data:

1. **Reading Text Data:**
   - Reads the content of the 'AK2.txt' file, which contains the client data.

2. **Chunking Text:**
   - Splits the text into chunks based on the pattern '-----'.

3. **Cleaning Chunks:**
   - Removes empty chunks to ensure data consistency.

4. **Extracting Rates and Fringes Information:**
   - Uses regular expressions to find sections containing 'Rates' and 'Fringes'.

5. **Processing Extracted Text:**
   - Replaces specific patterns in the extracted text.

6. **Extracting Detailed Information:**
   - Applies regular expressions to extract detailed information such as job title, rate, fringe, and category.

7. **Handling Various Cases:**
   - Manages different cases, including job titles with multiple categories, cases with brackets, and cases with commas.

8. **Displaying Results:**
   - Outputs the extracted client data, including job title, rate, fringe, and category.

## Customization

- The script can be customized for different text file formats or variations in data patterns.
- Modify the regular expressions or processing logic based on the specific structure of the client data.

## Notes

- This code is provided as a generic solution and may require adjustments for specific use cases.
- Ensure that the 'AK2.txt' file is appropriately formatted and contains the necessary client data.
